A 2D Turn-Based Strategy Game
ðŸ“œ Overview
Shape Conquest is a 2D turn-based strategy game that blends classic board game mechanics with the simple, yet profound, logic of "Rock, Paper, Scissors." Players command an army of geometric shapesâ€”Triangles, Circles, and Squaresâ€”on a grid-based map. The objective is not to destroy the enemy, but to convert them to your side, leading to dynamic shifts in power and a strategic battle for board control.

ðŸŽ¯ Game Objective
The primary goal is to achieve board supremacy by strategically outmaneuvering your opponent. You win by converting enemy units into your own, growing your army and diminishing your opponent's until you dominate the map.
